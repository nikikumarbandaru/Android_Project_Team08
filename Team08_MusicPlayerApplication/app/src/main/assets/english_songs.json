(Tale as old as time)\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\nOne day I'll watch as you're leaving\nAnd life will lose all its meaning\n(For the last time)\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\nAt tea time, everybody agrees\nI'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\nI have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money\nShe thinks I left them in the will\nThe family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out\n\"She's laughing up at us from hell\"\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\nIt's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees\nIt's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\nAt tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)\nI'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"
